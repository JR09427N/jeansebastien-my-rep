##Snake Game

#Here is a snake game I've created written in Java using the Eclipse IDE.

The user controls a snake using keyboard input to guide the snake to consume apples that appear randomly on the screen; upon successful consumption, the snake’s length increases by one square unit size and a new apple spawns.

There are color changes, sound effects, background music, level-ups, difficulty modes, and a game-over method, where if the snake’s head collides with its own body or the border, a game over screen is presented.
